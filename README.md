## Description 

_This simple C# application gathers input from a user from form input fields. The user can add "flavor" objects to a list of flavors, which are stored in a database table._

_Users will also be able to "treat" objects to a list treats, stored in a separate database table._

_Both flavors and treats will be displayed in a list on the relevant pages. The flavor and treat tables are connected via a third join table, titled "TreatFlavor."_
 
## Setup/Installation Requirements 

**Required Setup**

1) _You will need some type of coding software should you wish to view and edit the code. VS Code is an example of a free code editor, which can be downloaded at [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)_.

2) _Additionally, you will need to download the .NET framework, which can be downloaded at [.NET5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0)_.

3) _To effectively work with the database, download MySQL Workbench at [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)._

4) _Install dotnet script. Enter the command ``dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`` in Terminal for macOS or PowerShell for Windows._


**Cloning**

1) _In order to utilize this page on your local machine, you will need to clone a copy of this repository._

2) _Navigate to your desired directory in your command terminal and run:_ ``` $ git clone https://github.com/rjashby/CatsAndDogs.Solution```

3) _Once cloned, open the folder of the cloned repository in your code editor to view all the necessary files._


**Downloading**

1) _In your browser, navigate to https://github.com/rjashby/CatsAndDogs.Solution, and click the green "Code" button, which will provide a drop down menu. Click on "Download ZIP" at the bottom of the menu, and save it to your desired location._

2) _Once downloaded, unzip and extract the files._

3) _Follow the steps above to view, edit, and open the files as needed._


**Running the Program**

1) _In your terminal, navigate to the AnimalShelter folder by starting at the root directory and typing the following into your terminal:_ ```cd AnimalShelter```

2) _In the AnimalShelter directory run ```dotnet restore``` to download the needed dependencies._

3) _Once here, you will need to run the following in your terminal:_ ```dotnet build```

4) _Once the project builds (and no errors appear), you can run the program by entering the following in your terminal:_ ```dotnet run```

5) _If you wish to changes made in real time, you may run:_ ```dotnet watch run```

6) _At this stage, only the basic layout will be in place. You will first need to build the database to effectively use the application._


**Initial Database Setup** 

1) _Start by creating an appsettings.json file in the main/root directory. This file should BE KEPT PRIVATE and should be populated with the following lines of code:_

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[Your Database Name Goes Here];uid=[Your Id Goes Here];pwd=[Your Password Here];"
  }
}
```
2) _Ensure that your .gitignore file includes the following files before pushing to GitHub:_

``` 
*/obj/
*/bin/
.vscode
*/appsettings.json
```

**Creating The Database**

1) _Ensure that you have proper tools installed. Start by installing dotnet ef by running the following command in your terminal:_```dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef```

2) _You can now add your initial migration. This will add a "Migrations" directory to your "AnimalShelter" directory. Navigate to your "AnimalShelter" directory and run the following command in your terminal:_ ```dotnet ef migrations add Initial```

3) _You will now have an "Initial" migration with which you can build and view the database. Now run the following command in your terminal in the "AnimalShelter" directory:_ ```dotnet ef database update```

4) _If you want to view the database, open MySQL Workbench. You should see your database, with the appropriate tables and columns. Note: the database name will be based on the name you supplied. See: Initial Database Setup, Step 1._


**API Documentation**

Explore the API endpoints in Postman or a browser. Using Swagger Documentation:

1) _To explore the AnimalShelter API with Swagger, launch the project using `dotnet run`, and input the following URL into your browser: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`_

2) _The endpoints will all be provided when you go to http://localhost:5000/swagger. You can experimennt with the various endpoints in your browser or Postman._
